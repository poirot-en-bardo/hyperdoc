# Hyperdoc Internship Project

This project is centred on simulating different illumination types upon manuscripts of historical interest. 
The main function is *simulate_illumination* and it uses the reflectance hypercube of the target (the manuscript), as well as the chosen illuminants. 

The predefined illuminants are included in illuminants_table.mat, but the user can edit this table to add, remove or update the illuminants, using the static methods of the *IlluminantOperations* class.
